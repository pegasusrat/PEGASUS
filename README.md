## Interactive layout visualisation

Similar to Android Studio's LayoutInspector, you can analyse the level and scope of the interface and get information about the controls on the interface to facilitate operations such as clicking and swiping.
Controls can be selected with the mouse (see LayoutInspector for details) to see the corresponding information:

- bounds (clickable range)
- boundsInParent
- checked
- class
- clickable
- package
- resource-id (control id)
- scrollable
- text (control text)
- content-desc (control description)
